To answer my questions and transform these data into actionable insights, I draw from a variety of methods, ranging from econometrics and time-series analysis to machine learning, NLP, social network analysis, and qualitative analysis.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n![](newestpapers.gif){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n\n[Challenges of and approaches to data collection across platforms and time: Conspiracy-related digital traces as examples of political contention](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19331681.2023.2250779)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnnett Heft, Kilian Buehling, Xixuan Zhang, Dominik Schindler, Miriam Milzner\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n2024/7/2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nJournal of Information Technology & Politics\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](Star01.gif){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"20\" height=\"12\"}\n\n[Message deletion on Telegram: Affected data types and implications for computational analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19312458.2023.2183188)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nKilian Buehling\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n2024/1/2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCommunication Methods and Measures\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\nPlease feel free to get in touch!\n",
